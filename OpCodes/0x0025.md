## Description

Waits for a dialog select (created by opcode `0x0024`) to be made by the player.

This function operates like a yielded coroutine. When first called, the handler checks to ensure a dialog has been created. If not, the handler moves the `ExecPointer` ahead beyond the opcode and sets the `RetFlag`, effectively skipping the opcode. `_(**Note:** This is odd as it does not error handle bad dialog loads and could cause you to select a dialog option you didn't want.)_ If a dialog is found, then the handler will instead check and make sure the dialog is valid.

Afterward, a call to `CTkQueryControl::IsOK` is made, which is kind of misleading name wise. This is actually the way to get the players selection index. This function will return `0` until a selection is made. Pressing escape or forcing the dialog closed will cause it to return `255` as an invalid index, this lets the handler know that the player has exited the dialog without making a selection.

When the user exits the dialog without a selection, `254` is stored into `Work_Zone[0]`. If the user makes a selection, then `selectedIndex - 1` is stored into `Work_Zone[0]` instead.

## Pseudo Code

_**Note**: The pseudo code shown here is stripped of some unneeded junk to focus on the purpose of the opcode._

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x0025(xievent_t* this)
{
    if (!PTR_TalkWinFlag)
    {
        // Dialog cleanup happens here..

        this->ExecPointer += 1;
        this->RetFlag = 1;

        return;
    }

    // Unknown dialog object calls happen here..

    const auto isOk = FUNC_CTkQueryControl_IsOK(PTR_TalkpQW);
    if (!isOk)
    {
        this->RetFlag = 1;
        return;
    }

    this->ExecPointer++;

    if (isOk == 255)
    {
        PTR_Work_Zone[0] = 254;

        // Dialog cleanup happens here..

        PTR_EventExecEnd    = 1;
        PTR_UnknownFlag     = 1;
        PTR_CancelEVent     = 1;
    }
    else
    {
        PTR_Work_Zone[0] = isOk - 1;
        
        // Dialog cleanup happens here..
    }

    this->RetFlag = 1;
}
```
