## Description

Jumps to a new position in the event data.

Jumps work similar to making a call to a function, where the function can return back to where the jump took place. The event VM allows up to 8 jumps to be taken at the same time, meaning you can make up to 8 jumps without returning from a previous jump. If the byte code attempts a 9th jump, it will fail and the `ReqStack` execution will be killed by setting the `RetFlag`.

When a jump is performed, the jump position is read from the byte code value. The `ExecPointer` is then moved `+3` ahead to step over the jump opcode. This new position is then stored into the next slot of the `JumpTable` stack. The `ExecPointer` is then set to the read value from the byte code and execution continues at the new location.

Jumps are returned with opcode: `0x001B`

## Source Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x001A(xievent_t *this)
{
    if (this->JumpTableIndex == 8)
    {
        this->RetFlag = 1;
        return;
    }

    this->JumpTable[this->JumpTableIndex] = this->ExecPointer + 3;
    ++this->JumpTableIndex;

    this->ExecPointer = FUNC_XiEvent_getworkofs_(this, 1);
}
```
