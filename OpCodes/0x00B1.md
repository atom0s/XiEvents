# OpCode: 0x00B1

| Information               | Notes |
|---                        |---    |
| **OpCode**                | `B1 ?? ?? ??` |
| **OpCode Size**           | `4`   |
| **Sets `RetFlag`?**       | `No`  |
| **Sets `ExecPointer`?**   | `Yes` |

## Description

Gets and stores the value of a flag. `PTR_UnknownValue` is part of the main `app` object which is initialized to `128`. This valid doesn't seem to ever change, and has been the same since the original beta of the game. _At this time, the purpose of this value is unknown._

## Pseudo Code

```cpp
void __thiscall FUNC_XiEvent_OpCode_0x00B1(xievent_t* this)
{
    if (this->EventData[this->ExecPointer + 1])
    {
        if (this->EventData[this->ExecPointer + 1] == 1)
        {
            FUNC_XiEvent_setworkofs_(this, 2, PTR_UnknownValue & 1);
            this->ExecPointer += 4;
        }
        else if (this->EventData[this->ExecPointer + 1] == 2)
        {
            FUNC_XiEvent_setworkofs_(this, 2, 1);
            this->ExecPointer += 4;
        }
    }
    else
    {
        FUNC_XiEvent_setworkofs_(this, 2, (PTR_UnknownValue >> 1) & 3);
        this->ExecPointer += 4;
    }
}
```
